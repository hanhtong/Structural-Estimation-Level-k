# Structural-Estimation-Level-k
An example of structural estimation for Level-k model for strategic reasoning.

This is part of the code for a research on individual heterogeneity in reasoning.
The study used Traveler's Dilemma game and considered 15 models for strategic reasoning.
This piece of code is for one of the 15 models.
The model is a Level-k model, with L0 playing the upper bound of the guessing range, and with uniform errors.
